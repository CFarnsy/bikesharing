NYC Citibike:

## Analysis of the NYC Citibike program

### Overview of the Statistical Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to review a bike-sharing program in New York City to see if a similar program could be implemented in Des Moines.  The analysis will be used in a business proposal and presented to investors who are interested in backing the Des Moines ride-sharing program.

The data used in the analysis is from the Citibike website.  The data for the month of August was used in the analysis to capture the tourist and non-tourist populations.  

Overall, the information included data for 2.3 million riders.  There are approximately 1.9 million (81%) subscribers and about 440 thousand (19%) non-subscribers. There were approximately 1.5 million (65%) Males, 590 thousand (25%) Females, and 226 thousand (10%) unknown riders.

### Results: 

One analysis shows the top starting and ending locations for each bike trip based on the total number of bikes used. A map shows the locations of the starting and ending points.  I’ve included a list of name for the top 15 locations for each as well.

The next analysis shows the peak rental hours for Male and Female customers.  As you can see from the graph below there is a significant difference between the number of rentals by a female vs. a male.  However, both graphs show the same peak rental times between 5 – 7 PM followed by 8 AM and 9 AM.

An analysis was also completed showing the breakdown of bike rentals by hour.  That breakdown was further split between genders.  The results of the analysis below shows the expected results of a significantly higher number of rentals from males with the graph of overall trips following the same curve as the male gender curve.

The next analysis conducted shows the rentals by day of the week per hour.  There are three heatmaps showing number of trips by weekday per hour, number of trips by weekday per hour by gender, and number of trips by weekday by gender.  The three heatmaps are showing the same data just slightly differently :
-	As expected, the heatmaps show the heaviest usage by males.  
-	The daily high volume are at 8 AM and 5 – 7 PM during the week for both males and females.  
-	On Sunday the peak hours for males are noon to 5 PM but only 5 – 7 PM for females.  
-	On Saturday, the peak hours for males are 9 AM – 7 PM and 11 AM – 1 PM for females.  
-	The peak hours for the unknown gender are on Saturday between 10 AM – 7 PM and Sunday 12 – 5 PM.  
-	One point of interest is Wednesday’s for both male and females, which shows lighter volumes in the afternoon followed by a increase on Thursday morning and afternoon.

We also analyzed the bike usage and discovered there are several bikes that have logged more than 2 million miles while other bikes have barely been used.

This graph shows the utilization of each bike with the circles representing the number of miles per bike.

The last graph shows the best hours to take bikes out of service for maintenance.  As expected, it is early in morning when there are the least number of customers using bikes.

### Summary:

Based on the data provided it appears the heaviest usage of the bikes are from subscribers, instead of tourists.  The heaviest usage days are during the week between 5 – 7 PM followed by 8 AM, except Wednesday afternoons.  Males make up the majority of the usage during weekdays as well as over the weekends.

An additional data point I would suggest for future analysis are the average length of each trip, this will help better understand bike utilization rates.  Another data point I would suggest analyzing in the future is the top twenty trips.  This would help gain a better understand of the bike usage for future planning.
